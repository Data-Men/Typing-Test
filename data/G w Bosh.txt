Sworn in as the President of USA in January, 2001 and for a 2nd term in January 2005. His presidency had transformed the world political scene. The suicide attack on the World Trade Centre in New York city on September 11, 01, changed not only the history of America but has left an indelible mark on the world at large.


Terrorism has assumed a new dimension and its identification with the Islamic world has revived the theory advocated by Huttington in his book, “Clash of Civilisations”. President Bush has himself more or less endorsed this thesis by talking of crusades and Christian values. President Bush launched an invasion of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, to exterminate the hideouts of Osama bin Laden and make America safe and secure for all times to come.

Afghanistan’s policy, like his Iraq policy, has totally failed. The Taliban in Afghanistan have re-emerged as a potent force. Hamid Karzai’s writ is confined only to the Kabul city.
